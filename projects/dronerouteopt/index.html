    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, is rapidly growing in a wide range of wireless networking applications. The advancement in communication, networking, computation, and sensing technologies has attracted researchers, hobbyist, and investors to deploy mini UAVs due to their enormous applications. Drones have boundless viable applications as well due to its small size and capability to fly without an on-board pilot such as in agriculture, photography, surveillance, and numerous public services. The use of drones for achieving high speed wireless communication is one of the most significant applications for next generation communication system (5G). Indeed, drone-based communication network offers encouraging solution to provide wireless connectivity for devices without infrastructure coverage due to e.g., severe shadowing by urban or mountainous terrain, or damage to the communication infrastructure caused by natural disasters.</p>
<p>UAVs can be used as communication relay nodes, or air base stations (BSS), for reliable communication connections with users on the ground. When used as an aerial base station, UAVs have a significant advantage over traditional ground base stations because of their ability to adjust altitude, avoid obstacles, and increase the likelihood of establishing ground line-of-sight (LoS) communication links for users.</p>
<p>While there are many advantages to using UAVs as air communication relay nodes, there are still some key questions about UAVs technology. For instance, three-dimensional deployment, performance analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency, wireless and computational resource allocation, and trajectory optimization. Also when some UAVs work together, we need to consider UAVs swarm problem, e.g, routing and planning for UAVs group work.</p>
