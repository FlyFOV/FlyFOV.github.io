      <description>词法分析中的贪心法： 从左到右一个字符一个字符的读入，如果该字符可能组成一个符号，那么再读入下一个字符，判断已读入的两个字符组成的字符串是否可能是一个符号的组成部分。如果可能，继续读入下一个字符，重述上述判断。
整型常量 如果一个整型常量的第一个字符是数字0，那么该常量将被视作八进制数。
字符与字符串 用单引号引起的一个字符代表一个整数（ASCII），而用双引号引起的字符代表一个指向无名数组起始字符的指针。
理解函数的声明 (fp)()为调用该函数的方式，ANSI C允许程序员将该式简写为fp()
((void)(*)())0)() 编写一个独立运行于某种微处理器伤的C程序。当计算机启动时，硬件将调用首地址为0的子例程
注意作为语句结束标志的分号 如果一个函数返回值为void，此时编译器会隐含的将函数返回值类型视作int类型 指针与数组 数组与指针的区别
0 1 2 3  *(*（calendar+4）+7） = calendar[4][7] int calendar[12][31] int(*monthp)[31] monthp = calendar   非数组的指针 检查malloc是否调用成功，并注意使用完后释放空间。 作为参数的数组声明 如果我们使用数组名作为参数，那么数组名会立刻被转换为指向该数组第一个元素的指针。 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  main(int argc,char* argv[]) { } main(int argc,char ** argv) { }   避免举隅法 synecdoche
0 1  char *q,*q p = &amp;#34;xyz&amp;#34;   空指针并非空字符串 编译器保证由0(NULL)转换而来的指针不等于任何指针。当常数0被转换为指针使用时，这个指针绝对不能被解除饮用(dereference)。换句话说，当我们将0赋值给一个指针变量时，绝对不能企图使用该指针所指向的内存中存储的内容。</description>

      <description>Intro Electromyogram (EMG) signal is very popular in hand gesture analysis, prostheses control technologies. The EMG signal is generated by the human muscles and can be collected using censors, different movements of our muscles can result in different features of EMG signal, like frequency and amplitude. However, the classification of EMG signal is not an easy job due to mainly two reasons. Firstly, the noisy behaviors of EMG signal can influence the recognize process.</description>

      <description>I am currently a master student in Kings College London, department of Informatics.
I am a person who intersts every thing about technology. I took part in projects from hardware level to software level, I learned dozens of programming languages,from hardware design language HDML,Verilog to C for embdedded system(especially under Linux platform). I am also good at python ,Go which mainly used for data processing and machine learning in my recent projects.</description>

      <description>Introduction The project our team is working on is an interactive web page based on the recent Corona Virus outbreak, where users can learn about changes in air quality, human flow and so on before and after the outbreak,so that they are able to schedule their travel plans during the outbreak. During this gradually relieving-period, the covering capabilities of different regions vary from each other. So we used data on the number of people diagnosed in different areas to simulate the virus content(numbers) and realize part of data visualization to remind users keep far away from areas where they are still at risk.</description>

      <description>Introduction Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, is rapidly growing in a wide range of wireless networking applications. The advancement in communication, networking, computation, and sensing technologies has attracted researchers, hobbyist, and investors to deploy mini UAVs due to their enormous applications. Drones have boundless viable applications as well due to its small size and capability to fly without an on-board pilot such as in agriculture, photography, surveillance, and numerous public services.</description>

      <description>Introduction The electromagnetic wave can spread by reflecting from ionosphere and ocean, but the attenuation during this process limited the communication effect. In this paper, we discussed the situation that the electromagnetic wave propagation on the ocean.
Based on the Fresnel law and the calculation formula of transmission loss for shortwave skywave communication, we set up a model to discuss the calculation of the attenuation of calm ocean surface and the signal strength after a hopping.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project using a MCU combined with FPGA to achieve face recognition in real time. FPGA is much more fast in data loads and processing, which can acclerate the face recognition process. We use CNN as the traning method to predict the result. The projct got a nation second prize in National Fpga contest.   Certification </description>

      <title>Wild animal inspection system based on LoRa and UAV</title>

      <description>Introduction Traditional wild animal inspection system uses jeeps driving around the protection zone, which costs huge amounts of human resoureces and money. To optimize the wild animal inspection efficency and lower the cost of the procdure, we came up with a mthod which combines UAV and LoRa, which is a kind of long range communication device. We use drones to replace the jeeps and design the flying trail to cover the protection area.</description>

      <description>Introduction I took part in china national electronic contest, and ranked first among hundreds of teams in question D. The sponsor of the match is Texas Instruments. The contest requires us to design a digital balance system within four days and three nights. Our team has three members and I was responsible for software design. I only slept totally seven hours in four days to finish this project. I designed a program which contains analog to digital convertor, display unit using an LCD, temperature drift rectifies.</description>
